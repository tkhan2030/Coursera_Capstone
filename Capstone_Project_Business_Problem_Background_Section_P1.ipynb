    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Bloomberg News, the London Housing Market is in a rut. It is now facing a number of different headwinds, including the prospect of higher taxes and a warning from the Bank of England that U.K. home values could fall as much as 30 percent in the event of a disorderly exit from the European Union. More specifically, four overlooked cracks suggest that the London market may be in worse shape than many realize: hidden price falls, record-low sales, homebuilder exodus and tax hikes addressing overseas buyers of homes in England and Wales. \n",

    "#### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, it is urgent to adopt machine learning tools in order to assist homebuyers clientele in London to make wise and effective decisions. As a result, the business problem we are currently posing is: how could we provide support to homebuyers clientele in to purchase a suitable real estate in London in this uncertain economic and financial scenario? \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this business problem, we are going to cluster London neighborhoods in order to recommend venues and the current average price of real estate where homebuyers can make a real estate investment. We will recommend profitable venues according to amenities and essential facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores.\n",
